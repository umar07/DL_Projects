## About the dataset-
This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories(like shoes,top,tshirt,etc), along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
