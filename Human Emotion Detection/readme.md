# Human Emotion Detection
In this project I have used convolution neural network to recognize human emotions from the their faces.


## About the dataset-
This dataset contains about 14.3k grayscale images equally distributed into 6 distinct types- Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise. 
There are 11,475 training images, 1433 validation images, and 1438 testing images.

## Algorithms used-
* Conv2D, Max-pooling and Dropout layers.
* Fully connected dense layers for final classification.

## Accuracy result-
evaluated_accuracy = 94.5%
